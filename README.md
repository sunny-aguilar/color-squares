# Color Squares Web App
A simple fun game that has you guess the color of the squares. A hint is provided
in the form of the CSS property rgb(x,x,x). 

RGB stands for red, green and blue. It is used to display colors on a screen. The
value of each property can range from 0 to 255 therefore the higher the value, the
more of that specific color there will be. Example: RGB(255, 0, 0) specifies an all
red color.
